# Dataset4Landslide  
A large-scale and multisensor dataset is developed for deep learning-based landslide detection. The dataset aims to address the challenges encountered in landslide recognition. With the increase in landslide occurrences due to climate change and earthquakes, there is a growing need for a precise and comprehensive dataset to support fast and efficient landslide recognition. In contrast to existing datasets with dataset size, coverage, sensor type, and resolution limitations, the Landslide Dataset comprises 20,865 images, integrating satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle data from nine regions.
